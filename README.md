Garment cities around the world 
===============================
How much is the economy of each city dependent on the Nike factory or factories within it? This information could be used by humanitarian organisations to calculate risk factors should Nike decide to move their activities from a particular location, or
to help with economic development planning.

There is [detailed data](http://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/maps/export_json?) on
Nikeâ€™s factories in cities around the world, including the number of workers they employ in each factory. Nike do already have [good visualisations](http://nikeinc.com/pages/manufacturing-map) of their data, for example demonstrating gender distribution.

The UN make available [a database of city populations](data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode%3a240), but this information cannot easily be accessed via an API. [This scraperwiki scraper](https://classic.scraperwiki.com/scrapers/city_population_by_sex_city_and_city_type_un_data/) provides an API on this data.

We found that there are 490 cities in 42 countries with Nike factories and
calculated the total number of Nike factory employees in each city from
the Nike data. We intend to compare these numbers with the total
populations from each of the cities as found in data from the UN to
calculate which cities are most dependent.

Further work
------------
The [Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA)](http://www.bgmea.com.bd/) have data on all garment manufacturers in Bangladesh. This could provide an alternative source for doing a calculation on factory dependencies in Bangladesh.
