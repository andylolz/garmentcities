Garment cities around the world 
===============================

There is [detailed data](http://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/maps/export_json?) on
Nikeâ€™s factories in cities around the world,
including the number of workers they employ in each factory. Nike do
already have [good visualisations](http://nikeinc.com/pages/manufacturing-map) of their data, for example demonstrating
gender distribution, however we wanted to see how much the economy of each
city depends on the Nike factory or factories within it. This information
could then be used by humanitarian organisations to calculate risk factors
should Nike decide to move their activities from a particular location or
to help with economic development planning.
 
We found that there are 490 cities in 42 countries with Nike factories and
calculated the total number of Nike factory employees in each city from
the Nike data. We then intended to compare these numbers with the total
populations from each of the cities as found in data from the UN to
calculate which cities were most dependent. However UN data cannot be
downloaded in an easy to use format making it very difficult to
cross-match the data using python and come up with results. 

Since we were unable to follow our original plan one of the team members
is from Bangladesh and shared the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (BGMEA) who have data on all garment manufacturers
in Bangladesh. This could potentially be an alternative source for doing
a calculation on Nike dependency in Bangladesh.
